The cloud version comes up with a server and will auto-provision Mumara dependencies to give you an installed copy of the product. You’ll receive the Mumara login details in an email within a few minutes of placing a successful order. If you are not willing to take the hassles to go through server setup and installation processes, this is the right choice for you."
