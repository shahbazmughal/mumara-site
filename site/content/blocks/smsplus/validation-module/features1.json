Regulatory authorities always keep an eye on message failure rate to single out services that relay unsolicited messages. Validation helps your clients separating out invalid numbers that reflect potential failure, and maintain a list that carries deliverable contacts only. Validated lists leave failure rate as low as unnoticeable.",
