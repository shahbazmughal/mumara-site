You simply create few packages with sending volume, number of contacts allowed, number of Sender-IDs allowed etc. And your clients simply subscribe to one of the package they find suitable. These kind of packages mostly suit to the providers that offer service in certain region/country, where per SMS cost doesnâ€™t make significant difference across different networks.",
