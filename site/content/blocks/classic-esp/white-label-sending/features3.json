The bounce email address would receive notifications of bounce emails/non-delivery reports, and application using POP/IMAP will read and process these emails as bounced within the lists belonging to specific client account. So white label sending not only ensures better inbox delivery but also an accurate processing of bounced emails to keep the list clean.",
