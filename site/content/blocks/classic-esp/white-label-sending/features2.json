When a client setup his/her account for white label sending, it doesnâ€™t configure a sending domain merely with a CNAME record entry, the wizard also generates record values for primary mail authentications such as DKIM and SPF. Appropriate configuration of corresponding DNS records ensures better inbox placements.",
