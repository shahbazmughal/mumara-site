      "text": "During the start of any marketing strategy, devise two or more ways to communicate your message. You can choose different tones or languages to talk to your audience. Or choose different color combinations. Choose different subject lines. Now create different types of email campaigns. Once you do you will realize that it is had to choose between the top five or four. Or ten for that matter. Send them all out. Once you send these to the audience, you can see which one performed better. You can keep that strategy in mind or as your anchor for the future. This is the basis of A/B testing. You can gauge the conversion rate through analyzing goals such as the percentage of people who click on a link, complete a form, or make a purchase."
