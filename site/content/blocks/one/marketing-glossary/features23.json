For example, the welcome email is not just a single one-time email it can be a campaign. A drip campaign is a series of emails that you have already designed, scheduled and ascribed triggers to even before people are made eligible tor receive these emails. These can be in the form of email sequences that are completely made beforehand or some parts of them may be left to dynamic content tags and personalization abilities of the Mumara ONE."
