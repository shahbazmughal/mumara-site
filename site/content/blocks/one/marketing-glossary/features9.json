Others try to read it but stop midway, others do not even bother to skim it. This is why it is essential to send the right kind of email to each person. The right content of the email will result in clicks. Clicks mean that the user is going here you want them to. This could be to a signup page, a product page or anything at all. The click shows that your message is working. A clicker can be treated as a segment within your target audience that is interested and responsive to the stimulus you send them."
