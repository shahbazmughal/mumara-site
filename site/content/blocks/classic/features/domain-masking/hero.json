Effectively carried out mask forwarding process prevents the recipients to see the primary domain name. Moreover, it doesn’t drop the tracking link to actively monitor the results. This incredible feature of MumaraClassic keeps the primary/ installation domain hidden, which eventually reduces the chances of getting trapped by the filters.",
