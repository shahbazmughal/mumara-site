It is something you can do using Spin Tag function of MumaraClassic. Add variations in the content to make it relevant and somewhat unique for the contacts in the list, keeping bulk sending and content filters prospective in mind. Spin tag will let you provide alternative words or lines that will systematically rotate or spin for each recipient. One needs not to go through from a complex process to handle rotation; the spin tag feature automatically replaces the words and keeps spinning among the available alternative words, until the campaign finishes.",
