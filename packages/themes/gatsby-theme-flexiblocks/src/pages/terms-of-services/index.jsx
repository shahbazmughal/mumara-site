              <li>The portion of SaaS mainly consists of Campaign+, SMS+ and MumaraSMS, more can be released in future. This portion of SaaS apps is the hosted ones and you typically sign-up for the paid subscription to use the services.</li>
              <li>Once you sign-up for an account and subscribe to a package, Mumara auto-provisions the installation process on a remote instance, and grants you exclusive and non-transferable access to your account/user license. You can access your account from anywhere globally to start using your services.</li>
              <li>You cannot request the transfer of your account, or demand the installation of the license to a server/location of your choice.</li>

              <li>You arenâ€™t allowed to lease or lend any sublicenses by charging the money or even free of cost. However this does not prevent you to use the application for regular business course.</li>
